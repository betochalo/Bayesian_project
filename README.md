# Probabilistic Solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations
## Prior model for a fixed but unknown solution 

Probability modelling of initial beliefs about the uknown function, $u^{*}: D \times \Omega \rightarrow R^{n}$, satisfying an ODE initial value problem of the form,

$$
u_{t} = f(t, u, \theta), \qquad t \in \left\[0, L\right\], L>0,
$$

with fixed initial value $u(0)= u^{*}(0) $
